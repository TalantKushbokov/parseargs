## üìù Pull Request and Commit Guidelines

* Multiple Commits would ideally be [squashed](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-commits/squashing-commits) and merged into one commit wherever possible
  
* Do not use the merge button

* Commit messages would ideally reference the associated changed subsystem or behavior.

* Pull Requests for a new feature or bug fix must include tests. Additional tests or changes to the existing ones can made in the following file: [test/index.js](test/index.js)
